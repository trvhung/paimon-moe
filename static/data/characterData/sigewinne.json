    "description": "Blows a <span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Bolstering Bubblebalm</span> that can stimulate blood flow and help patients drift off to sleep using a bubblegun specially made in the Fortress of Meropide.\\nBolstering Bubblebalms will bounce between nearby opponents, dealing <span style=\"color: #80C0FFFF;\">Hydro DMG</span> based on Sigewinne's max HP to opponents it hits. When it bounces, it will restore HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. The amount healed is based on Sigewinne's max HP.\\nAfter bouncing 5 times, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will disappear and restore HP to Sigewinne based on her max HP value.\\nWhen no opponents are present, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will bounce nearby. Only one Bolstering Bubblebalm created by a Sigewinne may exist at once.\\nWhen Held, the Bolstering Bubblebalm can be boosted to an even bigger size.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Hold</span>\\nEnter Aiming Mode to begin blowing an even bigger, even more breathtaking Bolstering Bubblebalm!\\nThe Bolstering Bubblebalm will grow bigger the longer the skill is Held, until it grows up to two tiers in size. Each tier it grows increases its DMG by 5% and healing by 5%. When a Bolstering Bubblebalm bounces, it will drop down a tier in size, until it returns to being a normal Bolstering Bubblebalm.\\nAfter weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move.\\n\\nIn addition, 2 Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne collects will grant her a Bond of Life worth 10% of her Max HP.\\nWhen Sigewinne's Bond of Life is cleared, she regains 1 Elemental Energy for every 2,000 HP worth of the Bond of Life that was cleared. Sigewinne can regain up to 5 Elemental Energy in this way.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Arkhe: Ousia</span>\\nBolstering Bubblebalms periodically call down a Surging Blade on the position they hit, dealing Ousia-aligned <span style=\"color: #80C0FFFF;\">Hydro DMG</span> based on Sigewinne's max HP.\\n\\n<i>\"What do you think? Not only can this kind of hydrotherapy stimulate the circulatory system, but it can also cheer patients up, ooh, and that's not all, it can even help patients who ought to get some rest have a nice nap...\"</i>",
