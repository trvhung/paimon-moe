When it is deployed, it will cause Citlali to briefly be <span style=\"color: #99FFFFFF;\">affected by Cryo</span>.\\nAfter using this skill, Citlali gains 24 Nightsoul points and enters the Nightsoul's Blessing state.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Nightsoul's Blessing: Citlali</span>\\nWhen Itzpapa leaves the field, Citlali exits the Nightsoul's Blessing state.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Itzpapa</span>\\n·Itzpapa will follow the character.\\n·If Citlali has at least 50 Nightsoul points, Itzpapa enters the Opal Fire state and continuously consumes Nightsoul points to whip up a Frostfall Storm that attacks opponents within its AoE, dealing Nightsoul-aligned <span style=\"color: #99FFFFFF;\">Cryo DMG</span>.\\n·When Citlali's Nightsoul points are fully depleted, Itzpapa's Opal Fire state also ends.\\n\\n<i>Usually, the wills that symbolize different stars cannot coexist, for how can purest black be reflected in purest white?\\nBe that as it may, Citlali has never harbored a particular preference for colors themselves, and that is just how things played out.</i>",
