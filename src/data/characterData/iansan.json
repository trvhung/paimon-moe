It will also disappear after 1 second when you are not in a state of combat. While it is active, Iansan's Nightsoul's Blessing state will not end even if she is not on the field.\\n\\n<i>\"Power is not about natural talent. Power stems from unceasing practice.

If she runs out, or uses this Skill again, her Nightsoul's Blessing state will end. It has the following properties:\\n· Increases Iansan's Movement SPD.\\n· Holding sprint will switch Iansan to Rushing Thunderbolt mode, greatly increasing her Movement SPD temporarily. In this mode, Iansan can make flying leaps using terrain, or consume additional Nightsoul points to move on water or liquid Phlogiston while being immune to DMG from the latter.\\n\\n<i>\"Faster, stronger!
